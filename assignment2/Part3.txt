I can tell by looking at my histograms and tables of Petal Length that we could split it at a distribution value of >= 2.0. This would seperate the Setosa from Versicolor and Virginica. 

For the mean data of the iris dataset, it seems that Petal Width and Sepal Length differ a bit when it comes to medians. So far, it seems the Petal Length explains the greatest amount of data about each because of varying it is.

The boxplot for Digiset isn't showing too many outliters. The Standard Deviation of the sets are the only ones that have a wider gap between the two largest values. I would think that this is because the numbers used in the dataset grow to be quite large and a lot of unique numbers.
